	<strong>NOTE:</strong> This post is the second in a series
	about the practical development of crypto systems. If you like
	it, check back later to see if updates have been published.
      </p>

      <p>
	This post follows the philosophy of the <a href="encryption_manifesto.html">encryption manifesto</a> published previously.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>
	This article illustrate the development of a simple encryption system
	that uses AES256 in CTR mode and Fuse to provide a transparent interface
	to encrypted data.
      </p>

      <p>
	The choice of libraries and algorithms has been made according to the
	rules expressed by the <a href="encryption_manifesto.html">encryption
	  manifesto</a>.
	This project is a first showcase that illustrate how the rules
	of the manifesto can apply to real software. So, it is a natural
	extension of it.
      </p>

      <p>If you want to skip the rationale you can go directly to the section describing the <a href="#implementation">implementation</a>.</p>

      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      
      <p>
	Particular care has been has been taken in assuring that the program is portable, but also simple to understand and compile. In fact the program is code entirely in a single file, that produces a single executable.
      </p>

      <p>
	The program takes a single encrypted file, and provides, using fuse,
	a virtual filesystem containing a single plaintext file. This file
	can be used directly to store data, or a filesystem can be created on
	it using standard OS facilities
	<sup class="footnote"><span id="fn1r"></span><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Fuse has been chosen since it provides transparent access to plaintext.
	Consider the following scenario: encrypting a PDF file using AES.
	PDF viewers require random read access to all sections of the
	displayed document. Encrypting the document using, for example,
	a compression tool supporting AES, or even using openssl,
	requires to decompress the file to an unencrypted support
	before a viewer can open the it. This procedure is not optimal:
	it is true that is possible to decompress the file in a RAM only
	filesystem, but this requires explicit user intervention, and is
	error-prone. Using a virtual filesystem it is possible to avoid
	this problem.
      </p>

      <p>
	Another advantage of fuse is its wide adoption on every major
	operating system. Linux supports fuse, and also all modern BSD systems
	supports it (including Mac OS). Even on Windows there are compatible
	libraries
	<sup class="footnote"><span id="fn2r"></span><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.
	The program uses only standard functions and libraries, to keep
	portability issues to the minimum.
      </p>

      <p>
	Cryptographic primitives are provided by openssl/libressl, available
	on any major operating system. Functions imported are only the
	strictly necessary, and should be easy to replace them with equivalent
	ones.
      </p>

      <br>

      <span id="implementation"></span>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>

      <p>
	First we delineate a skeleton structure for the program, and then
	fill in the details in successive sections.
      </p>

      <h3>Fuse Basic Callbacks Functions</h3>

      <p>
	To maintain the program easy to understand, we implement only
	the minimal set of functions required for the program to work:
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong class="mono">Open()</strong> and <strong class="mono">close()</strong> are needed when.
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong class="mono">Read()</strong> and <strong class="mono">write()</strong> are the core
	of the program. These two functions provide a transparent way to
	access the encrypted data. We will use <strong class="mono">read()</strong> to
	decipher a block of ciphertext and return it to the user, and
	<strong class="mono">write()</strong> to re-encrypt user plaintext and store
	it back in the file.
      </p>

      <p>
	<strong class="mono">Stat()</strong> is used by <span class="mono">ls</span> to list the
	files contained in our virtual filesystem, and to get some information
	on them, like file size, preferred read block size, and access
	permissions.
      </p>

      <p>
	These are the only functions needed by fuse to create an encrypted
	virtual filesystem. We will now see what cryptographic functions
	are needed.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3>Cryptographic functions</h3>

      <p>
	To unlock an encrypted file, we first need to get the decryption key
	from the user. Assuming we ask the user a passphrase, we need a way to
	convert this passphrase into a key that is directly usable with the
	AES256 algorithm.
      </p>

      <p>
	There are several standard ways to generate a key from a passphrase
	(notably PBKDF2 or, more recently, scrypt). For this first program
	however we will simply take a salted hash of the passphrase, using
	SHA256, that provides an output of the correct size for AES256.
      </p>

      <p>
	To encrypt and decrypt data we will use AES256 in CTR mode.
	This mode is easy to implement and is secure if good values
	for the nonce are selected.
      </p>

      <p>
	From openssl we will only import the basic AES256 block function
	(AES256 in ECB mode), and SHA256. We will implement the other
	cryptographic functions we need in the code.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3>Input file and entropy source</h3>

      <p>
	In the previous section we never mentioned cryptographic functions
	related to pseudo-random number generation. In fact we externalize
	completely the PRNG.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since the program expect an encrypted input file to mount,
	even on its first use, we can just provide it a file of the
	correct size generated, for example, using <span class="mono">/dev/urandom</span>:
      </p>

      <pre>dd if=/dev/urandom of=encrypted_file bs=16 count=1025</pre>

      <p>
	Note that we used a block size of 16 bytes since AES operates on
	blocks of 128 bits. If we use the last of these blocks to contain
	the nonce (plus eventually other header's fields), we obtain a file
	containing 16Kb of encrypted data plus 16 bytes of header.
      </p>

      <p>
	In addition this file can be generated on systems that have access
	to good sources of entropy, and then copied on systems which have not
	(e.g. embedded systems).
      </p>

      <p>
	But the main advantage is that the program is not tied to a single
	PRNG implementation, and so is more portable and avoids many
	tricky problems that arise from a bad use of entropy.
      </p>
