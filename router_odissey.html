      <hr size="2" width="100%">
      <p>It was a single-digit September's day. Walking in the streets
        you could feel some new cool breeze flowing on the
        not yet covered skin. It was a feeling Luke always loved, <em>"Seems
          like we can breathe again..."</em></p>
      <p> September is the best month to pass in the city: summer season
        is ending, driving away the muggy weather, and a little bit of
        energy and enthusiasm are permitted to return.</p>
      <p> <strong>When common objects hides little secrets...</strong></p>
      <p><em>"I need a new ADSL router, I feel cut off."</em> The day
        before, won by boredom and curiosity, he decided to explore more
        thoroughly his home router.</p>
      <p>Maybe you don't know that most <em>'networked devices'</em> on
        the market, including routers, modems or even printers, use as
        operating system some lightweight version of Linux or NetBSD. If
        you try an Nmap scan of your ADSL modem, you'll probably receive an
        output similar to this one:</p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">Starting Nmap 4.76 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2009-02-01 15:35 CET
Interesting ports on 192.168.1.1:

Device type: Router|WAP

OS details: Linux 2.4.20 - 2.4.24

      <p>At least this was the output Luke received after scanning his
        Trust MD-5700. Port 80 was nothing new, he already used the web
        service several time to configure his internet connection.</p>
      <p>Now he was going to try ssh. A telnet connection to these
        devices is not very exciting, not only for the use of an
        insecure channel but for the annoying habit of telnet to send
        only one character at a time, making the textual session similar
        to playing the last EA title on an old GeForce card (personal experience).</p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">ssh root@192.168.1.1</pre>
      <p>After the usual request about the key fingerprint for an
        unknown host, a BusyBox shell welcomed him. <i>"Let's give a
          look..."</i></p>

      <p><i>"Umm, it's a MontaVista..."</i> <a
          href="http://www.mvista.com/">MontaVista</a> is a commercial
        Linux distribution, very common on ADSL routers and modems used
        at home. One of their product is an IDE based on Eclipse called
        DevRocket, for the cross-development of embedded programs. <i>"Might
          be interesting to ask for an evaluation copy, but I don't want
          to wait weeks for the delivery."</i></p>
      <p>The processor was an AR7, a mips architecture. Usually, on
        these systems, BusyBox and other programs use UClib, a
        lightweight version of the C standard library. <i>"With the
          correct toolchain I should be able to run my programs on this
          thing, even a simple tool like netcat should allow me to do
          funny experiments..."</i></p>
      <p>After a quick search with Google, and some useless downloads
        (binaries for old version of Linux), he found <a
          href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/binaries/">http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/binaries/</a>,
        where it is possible to download various UClib toolchain, to
        cross-compilate programs for multiple architectures. In
        particular he chose <a
href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/binaries/0.9.30.1/cross-compiler-mipsel.tar.bz2">cross-compiler-mipsel.tar.bz2</a>
        for little endian MIPS processors.</p>
      <p> <strong>How to break a router, in a few little steps.</strong></p>
      <p>Extracting the archive a new directory is created, containing
        the cross-compilation version of gcc, objdump and other common
        tools. <i>"I now need a vanilla version of netcat"</i>, and
        pointed his browser to <a href="http://netcat.sourceforge.net">netcat.sourceforge.net</a>, <i>"not using
          strange libraries is perfect for a first try."</i></p>
      <p> After extracting netcat, Luke looked at the contents with a
        bit of disappointment: <i>"Nah, it uses the autotools. I hope
          it's possible to shortcut the compilation..."</i> In the
        source directory only few C files and headers were present. <i>"Let's
          try a standard compilation:"</i></p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">mipsel-gcc *.c -o nc</pre>
      <p>The compiler complained about the undefined VERSION value in
        the misc.h header. So Luke added a personalized define:</p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">#define VERSION "v 7.0 MIPSle, by TheRouterHacker"<br></pre>
      <p>This time the compilation completed successfully, apart from a
        few warnings about missing 'random routines' (not very important
        in this context). <i>"I wonder why they continue to use
          autotools, they just slow down the compilation. And really,
          what system is gonna miss a working strncpy today?"</i></p>
      <p>Luke returned to it's now-deauthenticated ssh session, and
        reconnected. To update the firmware, many routers include
        standard file transfer tools, like wget, ftp or tftp. In fact
        both wget and tftp were ready to be used. <i>"I don't want to
          set up an http server just to transfer a file, let's see if I
          still remember some tftp tricks..." </i></p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">luke@pc$ netwox 167 -r netcat/src/
root@router# cd /var/tmp &amp;&amp; tftp -g nc 192.168.1.5</pre>
      <p>Netwox is a little tool that sometimes can come in handy. It
        includes about 200 functions, the 167 being a simple tftp
        server, a quick and dirty solution. <br>
      </p>
      <p>With the second command he transferred his
        custom version of netcat to the router, in the ramfs /var, since
        the other mount points were read-only squash filesystems. The
        only inconvenient is that every file loaded here dissolves after
        a reboot (on the other hand this makes the forensic analysis of
        the device more difficult).</p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">router# chmod +x nc

Remote port number can also be specified as range.  Example: '1-1024'</pre>
      <p>Luke smiled, <i>"It works! Now i just need a good idea on how
          to put all this to good use. Let's see if other tools are
          available on the system..."</i></p>
      <p><strong>Fast forward to now.</strong></p>
      <p><i>"Damn! I could not help but play with the firmware
          configuration tools. Now the router is bricked and of course
          there is no documentation on how to revive him..."</i></p>

        Requiescat in pace.</div>
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> This part of the story is based on real facts.
        Unfortunately the router retired ahead of time, and honestly I
        still do not know what I touched that altered the flash memory.
        These devices are very fragile, so do not execute unknown
        commands or tools even if present in seemingly harmless
        directories. Now the device is only accessible via <a
          href="http://www.seattlewireless.net/ADAM2">ADAM2</a>, so if
        someone with the same router model would like to help me fix it,
        a few configuration values should suffice, he can drop me an
        email...</p>
      <p><i>"Here we are"</i>, Luke said, in front of the store of his
        favourite hardware reseller. He was in friendly terms with the
        owner and had done a few little jobs for him, sometimes being
        paid in kind.</p>
      <p><i>"What brings you here? What have you destroyed this time?"</i>
        joked the owner, knowing Luke's hobbies. <i>"Hey, this time it
          wasn't my fault!"</i></p>

      <p>Luke chose a DSL-2542B, one of the last DLink models. Is common
        knowledge that DLink devices ship with some version of Linux,
        they also include a copy of th GPL license inside the box of
        their products. <i>"If you continue like this, you are going to
          constitute a 30% of my business,"</i> the owner said a he
        walked away with the router.</p>
      <p><b>Back home.</b><br>
      </p>

          this one... But I do not want to risk another router, I need

        seconds an evil grin appeared on his face.</p>
      <p><b>Router discovery</b></p>
      <p><i>"I need a router that expose a command-line interface on the
          internet, and that runs Linux. These things are usually
          configured via a web interface, I could try a web scan..."</i>
        Luke remembered a little program that did what he needed. The
        program was HttSquash, part of the <a
          href="http://complemento.sourceforge.net">complemento suite</a>,
        of which had recently been released a GUI.</p>
      <p>He downloaded and compiled the program. "Good, now I have only
        to choose a network to scan." He opted for a Vietnam network: it
        is very unlikely that there are arrangements for the
        expatriation of foreign criminals. <i>"Ok, range
          123.*.*.1-255, port 80, timeout of 2 second. Scan started."</i>
        <br>
      </p>

          src="images/screenshot-httsquash.png" height="740" width="800">
        <br>
        Scan results.</div>
      <p><i>"Wow, this network has it all! Security cameras, routers,
          printers... And everything remotely accessible via an internet
          connection, and exposed to every kind of attack. Some Asian
          countries have not yet learned the lesson..."</i></p>
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> Indeed some countries are a real boon for people
        with malicious intent. It's easy to create botnet on these
        networks because the users are unaware of any security practice.
        Expecially for devices like routers and printers, not perceived
        as general purpose platforms. But, in reality, what differences
        exist between a PC and a router mounting Linux, for the purposes
        of a network cracker?<br>
      </p>
      <p><i>"I'll just try something trivial: let's see if they changed
          default passwords..."</i> And after four or five devices that
        didn't oppose the minimal resistance Luke said to himself: <i>
          "This place is an hacker gold mine! Just uploading a simple
          backdoor to these I could quickly create my own personal
          botnet: it's like stealing candy from a baby!"</i> But he
          wasn't really into these things, he just wanted to play a bit.</p>
      <p><i>"Netcat should be able to do a port scan on an internal
          host. It's very old school but let's try it anyway."</i> After
        uploading netcat to one of the devices of the network, he
        launched the scan:</p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">router# ./nc -z -v 192.168.0.5 1-1000

      <p><i>"Hehe, seems like a Microsoft Windows system. Now I can set
