	<strong>NOTE:</strong> This post is the third in a series
	about the practical development of crypto systems. If you like
	it, check back later to see if updates have been

	The <em>whys</em> of this post are explained in the
	<a href="encryption_manifesto.html">Encryption Manifesto</a>,
	the fundamentals of the <em>hows</em> in
	<a href="fuse_ctr_encryption.html">Fuse CTR Encryption</a>.
	The rest of the <em>hows</em> will be discussed in a future post.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      
      <p>
	Whe have seen in a previous article how to build an encryption program
	that follows our philosophy principles. However, that program was
	not well suited for full disk (or partition) encryption for its use
	of AES in CTR mode.
      </p>

      <p>
	In this article we discuss a different mode of operation for AES,
	called XTS, that is commonly used for full-disk encryption.
	We will delve a bit into its history, reason about its strengths
	and weaknesses. We will also try to derive a simpler version of
	this mode, to be used in our encryption program,
	that still maintain the same level of security.
      </p>

      <p>
	This post is somewhat more theoric than the previous two,
	but given the relative obscurity of XTS I found it necessary.
	Still I hope you will enjoy the reading.

      <h2>Legacy and History</h2>

      <p>
	Once upon a time...
	Even-Mansour scheme and minimalist in cryptography.
      </p>

      <p>
	Even-Mansour requires a random permutation to be used between
	the two XORs, to break the linearity of the scheme.
	Even a block cipher can be seen as a permutation function,
	where the particular permutation is selected by the password.
	Assuming the password is sufficiently "random",
	we can use the block cipher instead of the random perputation
	in Even-Mansour, in a first step to approach XTS.
      </p>

      <p>
	From this consideration, we fast forward to 2007, where ...
