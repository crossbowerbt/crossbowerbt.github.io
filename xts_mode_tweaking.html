      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>
		Whe have seen in a previous article how to build an encryption program
		that follows our philosophy principles. However, that program was
		not well suited for full-disk (or partition) encryption since it was
		based on AES in CTR mode.
      </p>

      <p>
		In this article we discuss a different mode of operation,
		called XTS, that is commonly used for full-disk encryption.
		We will delve a bit into its history, reason about its strengths
		and weaknesses. We will also derive a simpler version of
		this mode that still maintain the same level of security,
		to be used in our encryption program.
      </p>

      <p>
		This post is somewhat more theoric than the previous two,
		but given the relative obscurity of XTS I found it necessary.
		Still I hope you will enjoy the reading.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h2>Legacy and History</h2>

      <p>
		After the standardization of DES (Data Encryption Standard) in 1977,
		many questions arised among security professionals regarding its
		security. Its classified design elements were suspicious,
		and its short key length (56 bits, or 55bits considering the complement
		property of DES) made it possible for the US government to brute-force
		keys in an acceptable time.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Instead of discouraging the analysis of the algorithm, this
		secretiveness encourage an enormous academic research on DES,
		aimed at uncovering its design secrets and at improving on its
		weaknesses.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		What interest us in this article, is a particular proposal by
		Ronald Rivest, in 1984, to increase the strenght of DES against
		brute force attacks. He proposed a variant of DES using two additional
		keys, K1 and K2, each of 64bits (the block's length),
		used to XOR the plaintext before DES encryption,
		and the ciphertext after.
		This variant was called DES-X.
	  </p>

	  <img class="center" src="images/des-x.svg" alt="DES-X algorithm"></img>

	  <p>
		This simple modification of DES has proven to be very reliable, and
		gave rise to a series of studies that applied the same technique in
		different contexts.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Even and Mansour abstracted the concept
		and proposed in 1991 the "two key Even-Mansour scheme", creating
		a very simple block cipher that was also provably secure. In a quest
		to achieve a minimalist block cipher, their scheme was refined by
		Dunkelman, Keller and Shamir to use a key of only half of the
		original bits, but still maintaining the same level of security
		<sup class="footnote"><span id="fn1r"></span><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.
	  </p>

      <p>
		Even-Mansour requires a random permutation to be used between
		the two XORs, to break the linearity of the scheme.
		Particular kinds of block ciphers can be seen as families of
		permutation functions, where the particular permutation is selected
		by the key. Assuming the key is chosen at "random",
		a block cipher can be used instead of the random perputation
		in Even-Mansour. This is a basic notion to keep in mind to understand
		XTS (for the formal details refer to the articles in the footnotes).
      </p>

	  <p>
		Work on tweakable block ciphers.
		<sup class="footnote"><span id="fn2r"></span><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.
	  </p>

      <p>
		A following work, by Phillip Rogaway, described two generic
		constructions: XE and XEX (xor-encrypt and xor-encrypt-xor), to
		turn a generic block cipher into a particular kind of tweakable block
		cipher, suitable for hard-disk encrytion
		<sup class="footnote"><span id="fn3r"></span><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>.
	  </p>

	  <img class="center" src="images/xe_xex.png" alt="The XE and XEX constructions"></img>

	  <p>
		This scheme was later standardized by NIST, with some modifies, under the name of XTS (XEX tweakable block cipher with ciphertext stealing). Many of the full-disk encryption products available today are based on this standard.
      </p>

	  <img class="center" src="images/xts-aes.png" alt="AES XTS mode schema"></img>

      <p>
		After this overview on the history of XTS we can delve a bit deeper
		into the algorithm, and discuss how to simplify it and how to
		use it in our encryption program.
      </p>

	  <h2>Understanding XTS</h2>

	  <p>
		Before seeing how to simplify the XTS NIST standard a bit, we want to point at
		some peculiarities that make XTS what it is. Actually we will base our discussion
		on Rogaway's article<sup class="footnote"><span id="fn3r"></span><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>,
		since it is the basis for XTS.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		To understand why XTS is particularly efficient when used to encrypt hard-disks,
		we must know a bit of discrete matematics. In particular we need to understand
		how to do arithmetic calculations, sums and products, on finite fields (or galois fields).
		But first we also need to familiarize a little with finite fields.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Basic structure of finite fields</h3>

	  <p>
		Finite fields are mathematical structures of form (<strong>G</strong>, +, *),
		where <strong>G</strong> is a set of elements, + is an operation
		behaving like a sum, and * is an operation behaving like a product.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Since we want to be able to carry out calculations in <strong>G</strong>,
		these operations must also satisfy a series of axioms, called field axioms:
		<ol>
		  <li><strong class="list-block">Closure for sum:</strong>if a, b &isin; <strong>G</strong>, then a + b &isin; <strong>G</strong>.</li>
		  <li><strong class="list-block">Associativity for sum:</strong>if a, b, c &isin; <strong>G</strong>, then (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).</li>
		  <li><strong class="list-block">Commutativity for sum:</strong>if a, b &isin; <strong>G</strong>, then a + b = b + a.</li>
		  <li><strong class="list-block">Identity element for sum:</strong>exists 0 &isin; <strong>G</strong> such that a + 0 = a, for all a &isin; <strong>G</strong>.</li>
		  <li><strong class="list-block">Inverse for sum:</strong>for each a &isin; <strong>G</strong>
			exists an inverse element b &isin; <strong>G</strong>, such that a + b = 0.<br><br></li>

		  <li><strong class="list-block">Closure for product:</strong>if a, b &isin; <strong>G</strong>, then a * b &isin; <strong>G</strong>.</li>
		  <li><strong class="list-block">Associativity for product:</strong>if a, b, c &isin; <strong>G</strong>, then (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).</li>
		  <li><strong class="list-block">Commutativity for product:</strong>if a, b &isin; <strong>G</strong>, then a * b = b * a.</li>
		  <li><strong class="list-block">Identity element for product:</strong>exists 1 &isin; <strong>G</strong>, with 1 &ne; 0, such that a * 1 = a, for all a &isin; <strong>G</strong>.</li>
		  <li><strong class="list-block">Inverse for sum:</strong>for each a &isin; <strong>G</strong>\{0},
			exists an inverse element b &isin; <strong>G</strong>, such that a * b = 1.<br><br></li>

		  <li><strong class="list-block">Distributivity:</strong>if a, b, c &isin; <strong>G</strong>, then a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c.</li>
		</ol>
	  </p>

	  <p>
		We included these axioms here as a reference, but we assume
		the reader already know the basics of abstract algebra.
		<sup class="footnote"><span id="fn4r"></span><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		We must also specify what we mean by finite field: To be <em>"finite"</em> a field must
		have a finite number of elements in its set <strong>G</strong>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		It has been demonstrated that all finite fields have a number of elements p<sup>n</sup>,
		where p is a prime number, and n is a positive integer.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		This property makes finite fields naturally suitable for computer applications, where
		powers of two are very commons; for example, a 64-bits register can hold values
		from 0 to 2<sup>64</sup>-1, in total 2<sup>64</sup> values, while AES manipulates blocks of 128 bits, for
		a total of 2<sup>128</sup> values.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Arithmetic of finite fields</h3>

	  <p>
		Now, the definition of a field is not complete without the operations
		that acts on the set; we must find a sum-like operation and a product-like
		operation that satisfy the axioms for our finite fields.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The sum-operation is easy, and we have several candidates: we could use
		the usual sum of integers, modulo the cardinality of |<strong>G</strong>|,
		so that all results lie always inside <strong>G</strong>; for |<strong>G</strong>| = 3,
		some examples of sums are: 1 + 1 (mod 3) = 2, and 2 + 2 (mod 3) = 1.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Another candidate for the sum-operation is simply a binary XOR; this works
		very well for fields with a power of two elements. If |<strong>G</strong>| = 8,
		then the elements of <strong>G</strong> can be represented as 8-bits integers,
		and the sum is the usual XOR between bytes: 2 + 7 = 00000010 ^ 00000111 = 00000101 = 5.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		It is easy to prove that both these sum-operations satisfy the axioms 1-5,
		being associative, commutative, with identity 0, and having an inverse.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		For the product-operation things get a little harder. An easy case occurs when
		|<strong>G</strong>| = p, with p a prime number; in this case we can just use
		the common product, modulo p, in a way very similar to the first sum-operation
		we proposed. Some examples, for p = 5, are 4 * 3 (mod 5) = 2, and 2 * 2 (mod 5) = 4.
		If |<strong>G</strong>| = p then this operations satisfy axioms 6-10.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The general case, however, are finite fields with p<sup>n</sup> elements;
		you can check by yourself that, for these fields, the product module |<strong>G</strong>|
		no longer works: try finding an inverse for 2 in a field with 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 elements.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Maintaining the intuition that operations should be modulo some entity,
		it is possible to choose a different type of entity to act like a prime number
		for different product operation.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		One of the most interesting insights you can learn from Galois Theory is
		that for p<sup>n</sup> finite fields, there exists particular kinds of polynomials
		that behave like prime numbers:
		we can use polynomial product, modulo one of these polynomials, as our operation.
		Together with XOR sum, they satisfy all field axioms.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		For fields with p<sup>n</sup> elements The, type of polynomials we are interested in
		are irreducible polynomials of degree n. A polynomial is <em>"irreducible"</em> if
		it cannot be factored into nontrivial polynomials over the same field. For example
		the polynomial x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> can be rewritten as x<sup>2</sup> * (x + 1),
		and so it is not irreducible; instead the second factor (x + 1) is.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		There are also particular kinds of irreducible polynomials, called primitive polynomials.
		A polynomial is <em>primitive</em>, in a finite field with |<strong>G</strong>| = p<sup>n</sup>,
		if:
		<ul>
		  <li>it has degree n;</li>
		  <li>it has a root a &isin; <strong>G</strong>, such that {0, a<sup>0</sup>, a<sup>1</sup>, a<sup>2</sup>, ..., a<sup>p<sup>n</sup>-2</sup>} = <strong>G</strong>;
		</ul>
		We say that the root a is a <em>generator</em> for <strong>G</strong>.
		Note that we are simplyfying a bit the definitions here; if you are interested in formal exposition
		of these concepts, refer to a good abstract algebra book.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Why this mathematical <em>tour-de-force</em>? Because these concepts are very handy when applied
		to 2<sup>n</sup> fields: if we use a primitive polynomial to take the modulo of the product operation
		in these fields, we can use the powers of 2 to generate all the elements of the field.
		This is exactly what XTS does in one of its steps.
	  </p>

	  <h3>The XTS mode of operation</h3>

	  <p>
		Consider a generic mass storage device, such as an hard-disk. These devices stores
		data in sectors of a fixed length. Traditionally, for hard-disk, this sector length
		was 512 bytes. Compare this value with the block size of a modern cipher, usually
		128-bits or 16 bytes: it is necessary to use some mode of operation to fill the size gap.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Consider also how data is usually saved on these devices:
		long sequences of data are written in consecutive sectors,
		starting from a sector with a lower physical position
		and ending with a sector with an higher position in the device.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		A good mode of operation for these storage devices need to address
		both these characteristics, and in an efficient manner. This is precisely
		what XTS tries to do, and we will see here how.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		If we call the storage device sector a <em>"wide-block"</em> and the
		cipher block a <em>"narrow-block"</em>, the first thing we may say about
		XTS is that it is a mode that transform a <em>narrow-block cipher</em>
		into a <em>wide-block cipher</em>. For example it can transform an
		AES 128-bits block cipher into a 512 bytes sector cipher.
	  <p>

	  <p>
		We can see each wide-block as indipendent from the others, and concentrate
		on the transition from a narrow-block to a wide-block. This is one
		of the keys to understand XTS.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Overview of a wide-block encryption</h4>

	  <p>
		The images and the material exposed here are from Rogaway's article
		"Evaluation of Some Blockcipher Modes of Operation"<sup class="footnote"><span id="fn5r"></span><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The following image represent the encryption of a wide-block (having full size) with XTS:
	  </p>

	  <img class="center border" src="images/wide_block_xts.png" alt="XTS wide-block encryption"></img>

	  <p>
		The wide-block plaintext P in subdivided in narrow-block plaintexts P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>,
		each of them in encrypted separately. The output ciphertexts C<sub>0</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>
		are then joined together to form the wide-block ciphertext C.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Assuming AES as the narrow-block cipher, this image may represent the encryption of an hard-disk
		sector of size 16 bytes * 4 = 64 bytes.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The encription function E is represented as having three parameters: <em>i</em>, the wide-block number;
		<em>j</em>, the narrow-block number inside the wide-block (represented in the image by the numbers 0-3);
		<em>K</em>, the key used for encryption.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		In a concrete application i may be the hard-disk sector number, j the narrow-block inside that sector,
		and K the encryption key derived from user's passphrase.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Notice that without the parameters <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> each narrow-block in each wide-block
		would be encrypted in the same identical manner. In this situation if two input plaintexts are
		identical, then also their output ciphertexts would be identical, leading to an ECB encrytion scheme
		(with all its weaknesses).
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Instead <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> assure that even if two identical plaintexts
		occur, in two different locations, their ciphertexts are different. These parameters are said to <em>"tweak"</em>
		the underlying block cipher.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		<strong>Side note:</strong> There could however be a different problem. Suppose that there exists combinations
		of <em>i</em>, <em>j</em> and <em>i'</em>, <em>j'</em>,
		with <em>i</em> &ne; <em>i'</em> and <em>j</em> &ne; <em>j'</em>, such that
		for identical plaintexts the functions E<sub>i,j,K</sub>(P) and E<sub>i',j',K</sub>(P)
		produce identical ciphertexts. This would defeat the benefits of the tweaks and may pose
		security problems. Fortunately this occurrence is very rare, and a major point of the XTS security proof
		relies on this. We will not delve into this proof, refer to Rogaway's article if you are interested.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Let's see now how the encryption is actually done.
	  </p>

	  <h4>XEX and powering-up constructions</h4>

	  <p>
		We have said before that XTS is a mode that transform a narrow-block cipher (e.g. AES)
		into a wide-block cipher. We also said that a wide-block ciphertext is formed combining the
		smaller narrow-block ciphertext, each produced separately from the others.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		In fact each narrow-block plaintext is encrypted using a modified version of the chosen block cipher.
		This modified block cipher is said to be a <em>tweaked</em> version of the original one.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		A tweaked cipher is obtained by adding and combining some additional parameters,
		beside the encryption key, to the original block cipher. These additional parameters are
		called <em>tweaks</em> (sometimes <em>spices</em>).
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The tweaked block cipher on which XTS is based, is a modified version of
		the XEX algorithm proposed by Rogaway.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The basic block cipher can be described as:
	  </p>

	  <p class="center">
		E : {0,1}<sup>n</sup> &Cross; {0,1}<sup>n</sup> &rarr; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>
	  </p>

	  <p>
		It takes as input an encryption key K &in; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>, and a plaintext P &in; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>,
		and to produces as output a ciphertext C &in; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Starting from this signature, we can describe the XEX tweaked cipher adding only a tweak parameter:
	  </p>

	  <p class="center">
		E' : {0,1}<sup>n</sup> &Cross; {0,1}<sup>n</sup> &Cross; T &rarr; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>
	  </p>

	  <p>
		with tweak decomposable as:
	  </p>

	  <p class="center">
		T = {0,1}<sup>n</sup> &Cross; [1..2<sup>n/2</sup>]
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The tweak is composed by two components. These components are generic and can be used in many different ways,
		but since we are dealing with a very specific application (hard-disk encryption) it is more useful to
		anticipate how they are used in this context.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The <em>first</em> component i &in; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>, is the <em>hard-disk sector number</em>,
		represented as a binary string of n bits, inside of which there is the narrow-block to be encypted.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The <em>second</em> component j &in; [1..2<sup>n/2</sup>], is the <em>offset</em>,
		inside the hard-disk sector,  of the narrow-block that is going to be encrypted.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The encryption of a narrow-block is carried out by XEX as follows:
	  </p>

	  <pre>
<strong>Algorithm</strong> XEX
		
<strong>Input:</strong>
<em>encryption key:</em> K &in; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>
<em>sector number:</em> i &in; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>
<em>offset inside the sector:</em> j &in; [1..2<sup>n/2</sup>]
<em>narrow-block plaintext:</em> P<sub>j</sub> &in; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>

<strong>Output:</strong>
<em>narrow-block ciphertext:</em> C<sub>j</sub> &in; {0,1}<sup>n</sup>

<strong>Procedure:</strong>
<em>let</em> &alpha; <em>be the ???characteristic??? (maybe should talk about this before, and just use 2 here...) (NO: primitive polynomial used to represent) the finite field, containing 2<sup>n</sup> elements, inside of which we operate.</em>

N = E(K, i)
&Delta; = N * &alpha;<sup>j</sup>

C<sub>j</sub> = E(K, P<sub>j</sub> &oplus; &Delta;) &oplus; &Delta;

return C<sub>j</sub>
	  </pre>

  C_{m-1} <- XEX2(K, i, j, P_m || D)

return C_0 ... C_m

Algorithm XEX2 (K, i, j, P):
K_1 || K_2 <- K where |K_1| = |K_2|
L <- E(K_2, i)
Delta <- L*Alpha^j
return E(K_1, X xor Delta) xor Delta

XTS -> XEX2

We have now a cipher that only uses XEX2 as the fundamental block.
Let's visualize XEX2 a little better, using the image provided by rogaway
in his paper:

[IMAGE of XEX2]

The tweak strategy used by XEX2, relies on the fact that 2 (seen as a polynomial)
is a primitive element of the finite field GF(2^n). This means that all the
non-zero elements of GF(2^n) can be obtained taking a power 2^i, for some positive integer i.
