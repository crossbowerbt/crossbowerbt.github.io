      <h1>DNS Despoofing</h1>
      <h2>06 Aug 2010</h2>
      <br>
      <p>These days I was playing with some well-known tools to perform
        DNS spoofing in both *nix and windows environment: Dnsspoof
        (part of the <a href="http://monkey.org/%7Edugsong/dsniff/">dsniff suite</a>) and
	<a href="http://www.securiteam.com/tools/6X0041P5QW.html">WinDNSSpoof</a>,
        of which I learned only recently.</p>
      <p>I was analyzing the generation of DNS replies when I discovered
        something interesting. Can you spot where the problem is?</p>
      <p>The DNS request:<br>
      </p>
      <div class="image" align="center"><img alt="Forged DNS request"
          title="Forged DNS request" src="images/forged_dns_request.png"
          height="402" width="800"> <br>
      </div>
      <p>The DNS response:<br>
      </p>
      <div class="image" align="center"><img alt="Forged DNS response"
          title="Forged DNS response"
          src="images/forged_dns_response.png" height="402" width="800">
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>Is not difficult to see that, if a request is artificially
        forged to include arbitrary trailing bytes at the end, these
        bytes are replicated in the replies of simple DNS spoofers.</p>
      <p>These tools, since the response must contain a copy of the
        hostname queried, simply copy that part of the request using
        memcpy(), without fully parsing the header.</p>
      <p>Thanks to this little oversight, it's easy to find out if we are
        victims of a DNS attack that use one of these stateless tools.
        This may not be indispensable, for example, if the attacker is
        also conducting a MITM attack based on the ARP protocol: we just
        need to monitor the incoming ARP packets to detect anomalies.</p>
      <p>This trick comes in handy when the attacker is located on the
        router, or on an intermediate host of our network. In this case
        he is already "in the middle", and just need to monitor the
        traffic that traverse his machine to capture DNS requests. We
        may thus detect him, only if we are able to differentiate its
        behaviour from the behaviour of a valid DNS server.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I wrote a script, quite easy to use, to test if a naive DNS
        spoofer is intercepting your requests. It’s based on the <a
          href="http://www.hping.org/">hping3</a> TCL shell, which
        provides a little framework for packet forging.</p>
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> I also considered <a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">scapy</a>,
	but hping requires fewer dependencies and is more portable, and I
        always prefer not to add extra burdens to users or distributions
        maintainers. Being a maintainer can be a very frustrating
        experience when you have to fight against badly organized
        software. Remember to offer them a beer if you meet the
        maintainers of the distribution you use at a convention...<br>
      </p>
      <p> Let’s now see how to use the tool:</p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">root@backtrack-base# hping3 exec dns_despoof.tcl<br>DNS Despoofer - crossbower - 2010<br> Usage: hping3 exec dns_despoof.tcl &lt;server&gt; &lt;interface&gt; (&lt;action:search|crash&gt;)<br><br>root@backtrack-base# hping3 exec dns_despoof.tcl 192.168.56.101 vboxnet0 search<br>SPOOFER DETECTED!<br></pre>
      <p>We just launched dns_despoof in <i>search</i> mode.</p>
      <p>The IP address 192.168.56.101 is the IP of the DNS server you
        normally use (e.g. 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 for google's nameservers).
        You must also provide the interface where to inject the packet.
        I was running dnsspoof on a virtual machine so I specified the
        interface vboxnet0.</p>
      <p>After running, the script correctly detected a spoofer.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There is also another mode available: <i>crash</i>. This mode
        injects a malformed packet on the network, in which the hostname
        requested is not terminated by a null character.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The tools that fail to properly parse the request will exhibit
        a nice segfault, as the case of WinDNSSpoof.</p>
      <p>Dnsspoof, instead, uses the function dh_expand, contained in
        resolv.h, which is able to detect this type of error. A little
        snippet of dnsspoof:<br>
      </p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">if ((i = dn_expand((u_char *)dns, end, p, name, sizeof(name))) &lt; 0)
 return;</pre>
      <p>The output of the tool when started in <i>crash</i> mode is
        the following:<br>
      </p>
      <pre class="code-snippet">root@backtrack-base# hping3 exec dns_despoof.tcl 192.168.56.101 vboxnet0 crash<br>Bullet fired... Try again to search for spoofers:<br> 1) No responses: the spoofer has probably crashed (windnsspoof).<br> 2) Responses: it's a well written spoofer (dnsspoof).<br></pre>
      <p>A subsequent test in <i>search</i> mode will allow you to
        determine whether the tool crashed or not. This may also be used
        as a sort of fingerprint.</p>
      <p>Here’s the source code of the tool. It’s only able to make a
        request with the name “google.com”, but can be easily adapted:</p>
