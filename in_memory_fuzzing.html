      <p>Probably, if you're reading this article, you already know what <strong>fuzzing</strong> means. In short, fuzz testing is a technique for <strong>testing software</strong> and <strong>searching vulnerabilities</strong>: targeted software is feeded with malformed input, hoping for something abnormal to occur.</p>

      <p>In recent years many excellent frameworks have been published to help the tester in the development of an effective fuzzer (I like <a href="https://www.immunitysec.com/downloads/advantages_of_block_based_analysis.html">spike</a>, <a href="http://peachfuzzer.com/">peach</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sulley/">sulley</a> very much).  But, as always, there are some experimental techniques, which in future will allow the evolution of the field: in this case I'm talking about <strong>in-memory fuzzing</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>In-Memory Fuzzing</strong> is an advanced, and therefore even more complex, technique (but we'll see how to manage this complexity), which allows the tester to <em>fuzz individual subroutines of the targeted program</em>. This focused type of test has many advantages:
	<ul>
	  <li>The fuzzing process is <strong>faster</strong> and allows a <em>complete code coverage</em>, since it's possible to select the piece of code to test.</li>
	  <li>Targeting a specific program subroutine, allows to<em> bypass any obfuscation or decoding of input data</em>, making the <strong>development</strong> of fuzzing tools <strong>simpler</strong>, from this point of view.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      
      <h2>But how does an in-memory fuzzer work?</h2>

      <p>If we consider an application as <em>chain of function</em>, that receives an input, parses and processes it, and produces an output, we can describe in-memory fuzzing as a process that <em>tests only a few specific rings</em> of the chain (those dealing with parsing and processing).</p>

      <p>Having clarified this point, is now easy to illustrate the main techniques used today:</p>
      
      <h3>Mutation Loop Insertion</h3>
      
      <p><strong>Mutation Loop Insertion</strong> (<em>MLI</em>) modifies the target program inserting an <strong>infinite loop on the parsing subroutine</strong>, isolating it from from the rest of the function chain.</p>

      <p>
	<a href="images/in-mem-loop.png">
	  <img class="center" title="in memory loop fuzzing" src="images/in-mem-loop.png" alt="in memory loop fuzzing" />
	</a>
      <p>

      <p>This loop can test the targeted function with a large quantity of inputs in a very short time, eliminating superfluous program's code, and requires no interaction from the outside. This makes this method <strong>the fastest</strong>.</p>

      <p>However it has also negative aspects, being the method more <strong>difficult to implement</strong>... It requires at least some knowledge of <em>reverse engineering</em>, and the ability to write <em>code safely injectable</em> inside an active process.</p>
      
      <h3>Snapshot Restoration Mutation</h3>

      <p><strong>Snapshot Restoration Mutation</strong> (<em>SRM</em>) handle the program function chain is a different way: no code is injected, but, through the use of <strong>breakpoints</strong>, the fuzzer takes and restores <strong>snapshots of the process</strong> at the beginning and end of the tested function.</p>

      <p>
	<a href="images/in-mem-snap.png">
	  <img class="center" title="in memory snapshot fuzzing" src="images/in-mem-snap.png" alt="in memory snapshot fuzzing"/>
	</a>
      </p>

      <p>The effect is similar to that of an infinite loop, as in the previous case, but managed and monitored by an external process.</p>

      <p>This method has several <strong>advantages</strong> including the ability to <em>restore the program at a clean state</em>, and, of course, it <em>does not require</em> the writing of <em>assembly code</em>. This at a <strong>cost</strong> of a certain <em>performance degradation</em>.</p>
      
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      
      <p>Ok, the practical part, let's start with a question...  Did you know that, since version 7.0, <strong>GDB can be scripted in python</strong>?</p>

      <p>Yeah, I agree, it's a wonderful thing:  although at the time the development is not yet complete, with some adjustments, it is possible to <strong>exploit all the capabilities</strong> of the (u)nix debugger <em>par excellence</em>, within our python scripts.</p>

      <p>Moreover, since version 7.0, GDB is able to <strong>take and restore snapshots</strong> of the debugged process, with the introduction of the <a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Checkpoint_002fRestart.html#Checkpoint_002fRestart">checkpoint</a> command.</p>

      <p>Having found a so <em>confortable "framework"</em> (that, IMHO, has good probabilities to overcome similar solutions present in the Windows environment, also excellent as <a href="http://pedram.redhive.com/PyDbg/docs/">PyDbg</a>), I could not resist the temptation to write an implementation of in-memory fuzzer for (u)nix environments.</p>

      <p>The result was the creation of a <strong><em>small library to support GDB python scripting</em></strong>, with the <em>fuzzer inside the examples directory</em>. Let's look at its practical use...</p>
      
      <h3> In-memory fuzzing (in practice)</h3>

      <p>The fuzzer is composed of two scripts: the first, <strong>in-memory-break.py</strong>, is used to find functions to test.</p>


      <p>The script inserts<em> breakpoints at the beginning of every function</em> of the program and <strong>prints out their arguments</strong> in search of text strings. The <em>goal is to <strong>find the function that parses</strong></em> the input.</p>

      <p>Let's try to run the script against the vulnerable program contained in the same directory:</p>

      <p>I've highlighted the parsing function. This case was <strong>simple</strong>, because <em>the <strong>binary was not stripped</strong></em>, making possible to print function names. But even in the case of stripped binaries, it's possible to find the function we are interested in, <em>analyzing and trying to <strong>decode the arguments</strong></em>.</p>

      <p>The vulnerable program simply try to extract the domain from an email address: an <em>overly long domain triggers a buffer overflow</em> on the stack.</p>

      <p>Now that we know the function to test and the input type, let's try to see if our in-memory fuzzer is able to detect the bug:</p>

      <p>As you can see, <strong><em>fuzzing loop number 1032 triggered the bug</em></strong>: the input strings are simply generated appending 'A' characters to a valid email address, and when the domain part reaches a critical length, a buffer on the stack is overflowed, overwriting the return address (and stack canaries).</p>

      <p>Although this is script is very simple, <strong>it's a basis to build on</strong> to create more complex fuzzer. In addition it illustrates several GDB features very useful in this field:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><strong>Allocation of memory</strong> on the target process</li>
	<li><strong>Snapshots/checkpoints</strong> and their <strong>restoration</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Breakpoint</strong> management</li>
	<li><strong>Argument analysis</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you are interested in GDB python scripting or in-memory fuzzing on (u)nix system, you can visit the project website:</p>

      <p><strong>GDB Python Utils</strong>:  <a href="https://github.com/crossbowerbt/GDB-Python-Utils/">https://github.com/crossbowerbt/GDB-Python-Utils/</a></p>
      
      <p>You will find the scripts illustrated in this article under the <em>examples</em> directory of the project.</p>

      <p>I'm also trying to maintain a good documentation for the support library, so you may give a look at the <em>"snippet" page of the wiki</em> (<a href="https://github.com/crossbowerbt/GDB-Python-Utils/wiki/Snippets/">https://github.com/crossbowerbt/GDB-Python-Utils/wiki/Snippets/</a>) to see the implemented features.</p>

      <h2>Post scripta</h2>

      <p>Some additions to the original article, born after discussing some issues with visitors in the comment section of the previous site.</p>

      <h3>Hints for 32bit systems</h3>

      <p>The fuzzer was specifically developed for <strong>64bit systems</strong>: if you want to use it against 32bit application you must adapt it (if you send me an email I can give you a few hints...)</p>

      <p>On <strong>32-bit systems</strong> the <strong>arguments are passed on the stack</strong>: you can find them adding their offset to the %esp register.</p>

      <p>Example, a 32bit process read() call:</p>

<pre>(gdb) x/4x $sp
0xffffc09c:	0xf6bb17da	0x0000000b	0x09286d90	0x00002000</pre>

      <p>The first dword encountered is the return address, we are not interested in it...</p>

      <p>The first argument (the file descriptor):</p>

<pre>(gdb) x/x $sp+4
0xffffc0a0:	0x0000000b</pre>

      <p>The second argument (the buffer):</p>

<pre>(gdb) x/x $sp+8
0xffffc0a4:	0x09286d90</pre>

      <p>The third argument (max read length):</p>

<pre>(gdb) x/x $sp+12
0xffffc0a8:	0x00002000</pre>

      <p>To make the fuzzer work on 32-bit system you must <strong>change the code that read/modify the arguments</strong> of functions (I will probably change the fuzzer to make it multi-architecture, when I have time).</p>

      <h3>In the meanwhile the interface has changed...</h3>

      <p>Python integration in GDB has improved. Here is an interesting video that shows what is possible to do now:</p>
